Travel Planner with Route Optimization
Overview
The Travel Planner with Route Optimization is a console-based C++ application that helps users plan travel routes efficiently. The application utilizes various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts to manage and optimize routes between destinations.

Features
Add Routes: Add new routes between destinations with specified distances or times.
Find Shortest Path: Compute the shortest path between two destinations using Dijkstra's algorithm.
View All Routes: Display all routes and their distances or times.
Exit: Exit the application.
DSA Concepts Used
Graphs: Represent destinations and routes using an adjacency list.
Priority Queue: Used in Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path.
Hash Maps: Store the graph's adjacency list and shortest path information.
Sorting: Although not explicitly used in this example, you can sort routes based on distance or time.
Trees: The underlying structure of the graph can be thought of as a tree when considering paths from the start node.
Requirements
C++11 or later compatible compiler
